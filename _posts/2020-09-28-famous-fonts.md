## Famous Fonts

Without realising, whatever you read, wherever you are, every sign, menu, number plate and newspaper has a font type. These fonts are most likely being used in more than one form and have been around for decades. But who designed them and why?

Firstly we must distinguish between what is meant between a ‘font’ and a ‘typeface’ as there is an air of confusion as they are often used interchangeably.

* a typeface is the letters and numbers, the characters that let us put words on the page or screen
* A font however is defined as the complete character set within a typeface, often dependant on size and style. Fonts are also computer files that contain the characters and glyphs within the typeface.

## Classifying Typefaces

There are many families that a typeface can belong to. The most common classifications depending on their technical style are: **serif, sans-serif, script and display**. But they can also be classified by specifications such as proportions and spacing, all together equating the mood they display.

## But Why?

Due to the infinite combinations of font styles with different heights and spacing, serif or sans-serif, their appearance can elicit different emotions. Therefore different businesses need different fonts to convey their personality to their customers depending on their purpose.

## Georgia and Verdana

Designed by Matthew Carter, these fonts have been used for Time, Washington Post and The New York Times. However in recent years Georgia and Verdana were designed for Microsoft as these fonts are suited to be legible even at very small sizes on screens. In 1997 he was awarded the Type Directors Club medal, presented to those “who have made significant contributions to the life, art, and craft of typography”.
