My name is Rebecca Fish, I am a student at Oxford Brookes Univeristy studying Media, Journalism and Publishing. This website is part of my module focusing on typography. I hope to give some information on all things typeface and fonts. 

For my branding I decided to choose a green colour palette with white and elements. I feel like green in a colour I associate with education and learning which is the purpose of this blog, to teach my readers something. It is a calm colour and isn't over whelmingly bright when displayed on a screen, this can be jarring for some readers. By using different tones of the same colour it helps maintain an idea of coherence with no stark contrasts which can be unappealing with non-complimenting colours. For my banner I used two character drawings to represent my readers, one using a laptop, the other using a phone to show the different ways to access the site depending on preference. The arrow sign on the right side represents just four of the thousands of typefaces available and the points indicating different meanings and the directions they can lead to. 

My logo still uses the green and white tones to show the unitiy with the banner. I used the typeface 'Belgrano' for the letters 't,y,p,r,ap,h,y' which was serifed so it was more traditional and linked more to handwriting and personalisation. To contrast this, the 'Oswald' font used for the letters 'B,L,O,G' which is sans-serif and has a taller x-height, allowing it to look more computerised and typed which is more modern. This is also why I placed these letters within a computer to emphasise the differences is typefaces, modern vs traditional. The emphasis also helps to show
