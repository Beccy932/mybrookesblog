My name is Rebecca Fish, I am a student at Oxford Brookes Univeristy studying Media, Journalism and Publishing. This website is part of my module focusing on typography. I hope to give some information on all things typeface and fonts. 

For my branding I decided to choose a green colour palette with white and elements. I feel like green in a colour I associate with education and learning which is the purpose of this blog, to teach my readers something. It is a calm colour and isn't over whelmingly bright when displayed on a screen, this can be jarring for some readers. By using different tones of the same colour it helps maintain an idea of coherence with no stark contrasts which can be unappealing with non-complimenting colours.
